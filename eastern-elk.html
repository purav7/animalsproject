        <p>The Eastern Elk (*Cervus canadensis canadensis*) was an extinct subspecies of
             elk that inhabited the Northern and eastern united states, and southern canada. The last eastern elk 
            was shot dead on september 1,1877 in Pennsylvania.(wikipedia,n.d,para 1)</p>
        <p>According to the article,"remembering the eastern elk" by Susan Shea(jan 14,2019), Eastern Elks were
            once the most widely distribuited hoofed mamals of the north anerica, numbered in millions, and were
            adaptable to variety of habitats</p>
            <p>Male elks used to weigh around600 to 1000 pounds while females were about 25 percent smaller, and 
                had a cream coloured body with dark mane. They thrived in forested landscapes, grazing on grasses, shrubs, and
              tree bark.</p>
        <p>then how did these majestic creatures went extinct?  According to historical accounts, when European
             settlers moved in, elk did not hide, but continued to roam where they always had, foraging near 
             settlements, especially in winter. This made them an easy target, and reportedly settlers often
              killed more elk than needed: an “exterminating butchery” wrote zoologist J.A. Allen in 1871. In 
              Lives of Game Animals (1929), Ernest Thompson Seton commented, “There are few stories of blood lust
               more disgusting than that detailing the slaughter of the great elk bands.”(Susan Shea,2019,para 4)</p>
