        <p>The Dodo (*Raphus cucullatus*) is one of the most famous examples of an extinct species.
             Native to Mauritius, some believe that there name came from the dutch "Dadaars", which means stumpy
             tails or from portuguese "doido" meaning like a fool. Dodo was a flightless bird that thrived in its predator-free
              environment before human intervention.(Kanchwala,2023, para. 3) </p>
        <p>Dodo's were endemic and exclusive to mauritius island, they adapted to perfectly to the island's
           environment. their diet included tambalcoque tree as well as nuts, frootes, roots and small insects.
           Dodo's used to weigh around 15-20kg and were 3 feet tall with brownish-gref feathers, they had long beaks,
           around 8 inches in length with a hooked shaped tip(Kanchwala,2023, para. 4-6)</p>
        <p>How did Dodo's went extinct?, according the biologists dod's went extinct due to three reasons.
            First, it was the arrival of humans in their environment. Humans being their predators had a mojor hand in their
            extinction. unabated hunting by the sailors and explorers become the part of it.
            Second, the arrival of sailors and explorers just didnt welcome humans, but outside flora and fauna
            to their environmnet. dodo's used to lay their eggs on the ground, but these foreign species used to
            raid dodo's nesta and on their young and unborn, making these endemic creatures hostage to their own environment.
            Third, with more explorers, the natural resources were consumed at a fast pace, ultimating paving the way of their extinction.(Kanchwala,2023, para. 9-12)
        </p>
        <p>The story of the Dodo serves as a poignant reminder of the impact of human activities on
             wildlife and ecosystems.</p>
