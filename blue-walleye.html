        <p>The Blue Walleye (*Sander vitreus glaucus*), a subspecies of the walleye,
             also called blue pilke, was native to the Great Lakes in North America. these fishes
            were endemic to lakes erie and ontario, as well as to niagara river. </p>
        <p>According to Jarret Ruminski,"Up until the mid-20th century, blue pike were prized for their meat
             and sport anglers told tales of the spry little fishâ€™s fighting abilities. Between 1885 and 1962,
              commercial fisheries hauled over a billion pounds of blue pike from Lakes Erie and Ontario, with
               Lake Erie alone providing annual harvests of 20 million pounds of the fish during good years."(Ruminski, 2016, para. 3)</p>
             <p>Due to extensive overfishing and habitat degradation, combined with pullution and dehybridization
                 the Blue Walleye's population began
             to decline rapidly in the mid-20th century. Increased pollution in the Great 
             Lakes and competition from other fish species further contributed to its extinction.(Ruminski, 2016, para. 5)</p>
        <p>The government of canada's species at risk public registered as that the last blue pike was caught in 1965.
            On 1975, blue eye was declared as extinct by the u.s fish and wildlife services.(Ruminski, 2016, para. 6-7)
